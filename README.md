### Previous work

*   This time with feeling: learning expressive musical performance - Elegant data encoding technique, but limited to one track music( piano )

*   Multitrack Music Transformer - Beautiful architecture, but complex data encoding technique

*   CTRL: A Conditional Transformer Language Model for Controllable Generation - A transformer model that can be controlled by a set of attributes
### our innovation

*   We combine the best of both worlds: Elegant data encoding technique from "This time with feeling" and the beautiful architecture from "Multitrack Music Transformer", to produce a model that can generate expressive music for multiple tracks. 

*   We also explore the possibility to generate music with controllable style, but since we lack multi-track music data with style labels, we train a model with "CTRL" technique to generate single-track music with style labels.
